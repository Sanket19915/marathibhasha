# Excel Import Folder

This folder is for storing Excel files that will be imported into the database.

## How to use:

1. Place your Excel file(s) in this folder
2. The file can be in `.xlsx`, `.xls`, or `.csv` format
3. Once you add the file, let me know and I'll create the import script

## Expected Format:

Your Excel file should have columns like:
- **Category Name** (Marathi) - e.g., "अर्थशास्त्र"
- **Word (English)** - e.g., "Economics"
- **Meaning (Marathi)** - e.g., "अर्थशास्त्र"

Or if you have separate files:
- One file for categories
- One file for dictionary entries

## File Location:
```
storage/excel/
```
